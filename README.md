# Density-Stratified-Rigid-Lid-Linear-Shear
Matlab code to compute traveling wave solutions to Euler for a density stratified with linear shear as well as compute the spectral stability of the traveling wave solutions.  Uses a modification of the nonlocal fomulation of the water-wave problem due to Ablowitz, Fokas, and Musslimani.
